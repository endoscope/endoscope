BUGS:
-DONE endoscope-stats-collector doesn't stop on undeployment/redeployment, what is more multiple threads are started!
-DONE check what slows down queries (too much data?, missing indexes?): set this before fetching data!!! stmt.fetchSize = 1000

IMPROVEMENTS:
- DONE reset details after changing period
- DONE reset details after text search
- DONE allow to click top level elements without children
- DONE add loading image for all operations
- time on charts is in GMT time not in local time
- DONE set threshold to 1000ms and 3000ms
- add auto refresh of top level & detail stats
- add reset or short time range in order to allow current stats monitoring (partialy done)
- persist most recent page settings
- DONE add tooltip for long and/or nested identifiers that are partially hidden
- enable gzip compression in UI - we send quite a lot of data
- DONE set no cache for responses
- DONE calls per parent are incorrect:
        A 5->B 1
        A 5->C 1
        gives you
        A 10->B 1
            ->C 1
        but it should be:
        A 10->B 0.5
            ->C 0.5

MINOR:
- remove verbose logs for gzip storage
- example doesn't work well on JBoss (REST interceptor doesn't execute example calls)
- scroll to top after refresh/search/period change
- highlight selected row
- highlight whole block of methods - identation is not very well visible in case of many subcalls
